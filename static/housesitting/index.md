[<img align="left" src="{{ site.url }}/images/2012/12/GlennDixie.jpg">][1]Hi there! We're Glenn and Dixie, and we'd love to take care of your home and pets while you are away.

We are in our fifties and are currently traveling through Mexico and Central America. We are looking for interesting places and people and a reliable internet connection.

Early in our marriage we house sat a few times, including one opportunity that included caring for a bird and horse, including daily medical treatment for the horse. Since then we have owned and maintained our own homes, both old and new, for about thirteen years. Most recently we took care of two dogs and two cats in Chapala, Mexico for four months.

Our prior home ownership has given us much experience in home maintenance. We've done minor plumbing and gas repair, we've installed ceramic tile and we built a small barn. Glenn is not only handy but also very experienced with technology. He is the person you call when your satellite system isn't working right, or your wireless internet is on the fritz. Dixie spent many years working in veterinary hospitals and kennels, so not only is she an animal lover, but she knows what to do and NOT do when it comes to animal care. Both Glenn and Dixie have owned cats and dogs and still have a special place in their hearts for their Blue Heeler Tucker, whom they had the privilege of caring for all of his seventeen years.
